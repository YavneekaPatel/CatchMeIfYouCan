# CatchMeIfYouCan
HackHolyoke 2015: ## Inspiration Healthcare. Old people falling.  ## How it works The accelerometer (held in broach) keeps track of the angle between the elderly person and the ground. The data is automatically sent to a "brain" that is supposed to send out an alert to the proper authorities if a fall is detected. In addition, the "brain" also activates the pulse sensor, which tracks the patient's vital signs until the proper help arrives. ## Challenges I ran into HARDWARE! The accelerometer was difficult to get running in the first place, and we burned a lot of time getting it to work. Getting individual components to work together was also challenging, especially in regards to the pulse sensor.  ## Accomplishments that I'm proud of Zoe: Using 24 hours to create a really creative and well thought out project. Ishanee: The pulse sensor. Yavneeka: Bonding with my teammates as well as getting the accelerometer to work. ## What I learned We learned to never give up, because success is always within reach if you keep trying. Also, hardware is difficult to manage in a short period, and this should be factored into our plan of attack. Last, be flexible and willing to change the design because of how the prototypes are running.  ## What's next for Catch Me If You Can (1) Contacting authorities needs refinement (2) Making the stationary "brain" mobile (3) Proper activation of pulse sensor
